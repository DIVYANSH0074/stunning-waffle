System of linear Equation solver using parallel processing
Ax=B
Number of unknowns: n
Requirment: text file named "matrix.txt" consist of n*(n+1) elements

Refer code psys.c

Format of txt file:
Let's take n=3

system of linear equations:
3x+4y+5z = 2;
x+8y+9z = 10;
-5x+6y+2z = -1

3 4 5 2
1 8 9 10
-5 6 2 -1
Here last element of each row is constant matrix(B)
And first 3 elements of each row is elements of matrix A with coressponding row.
